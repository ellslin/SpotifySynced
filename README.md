🎵 Twisted Spotify Features

Welcome to the ultimate productivity + music experience!
This is our playful extension to Spotify that adds features to help you focus, reward your productivity, and sometimes roast you if you get off track. Perfect for students, professionals, or anyone who wants music to actually work for them


Features
1. Spotify Synced

Automatically creates playlists based on mood, weather, and location.

Never feel out of tune with your environment again.

Example: Rainy day + feeling stressed + at the library → mellow lo-fi vibes.

2. Spotify Locked

Blocks your favorite songs that make you distracted until you complete assignments or tasks.

Want to jam out to your favorite bops but haven’t finished your homework? Tough luck.

Motivates you to get things done—or suffer through boring alternative tracks.
